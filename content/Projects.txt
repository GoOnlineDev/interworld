PROJECTS
OUR ONGOING INITIATIVES: DRIVING SUSTAINABLE IMPACT THROUGH AWARENESS,
ADVOCACY, AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT
At Interworld, our mission is to turn knowledge into action, research into practical solutions, and innovation
into lasting impact. We support transformative technologies and homegrown innovations by creating
awareness, building demand, and actively marketing them to the communities, institutions, and industries
that can benefit most. Through strategic communication, marketing, and stakeholder engagement, we ensure
these solutions gain visibility, trust, and real market traction across Uganda.
Supertech: Redefining Energy Efficiency Through Awareness and Market Promotion
In partnership with Bizen Green Future Ltd, Interworld leads in promoting, marketing, and raising awareness
about Supertech, an Italian engineered combustion optimization technology certified under ISO 9001 2015.
Supertech enables industries and businesses to reduce fuel consumption by up to 12 percent and lower
emissions by up to 80 percent. Our work focuses on helping clients understand its economic and
environmental value. We do not manufacture the technology. Instead, we market it, educate users, and
broaden its reach across different sectors. For Interworld, Supertech represents a powerful combination of
efficiency, sustainability, and innovation.
Organic Fertilizers: Advancing Sustainable Agriculture Through Marketing and Farmer Sensitisation
Interworld actively markets and promotes locally produced organic fertilizers created through innovative bio
manufacturing. These fertilizers convert organic waste into high quality nutrient rich inputs that help farmers
restore soil health, increase yields, and reduce dependence on chemical alternatives. Through farmer
outreach, sensitisation efforts, and targeted marketing activities, we help ensure these fertilizers reach the
communities that need them most. Our work supports food security, enhances soil resilience, and promotes
environmentally conscious agriculture.
Calcifeed: Growing Adoption Through Awareness Creation and Market Outreach
Interworld plays a leading role in marketing and promoting Calcifeed, a nutrient rich animal feed produced
from Black Soldier Fly larvae. This innovative product turns organic waste into high value livestock feed that
increases productivity, improves animal health, and strengthens local food systems. Through awareness
creation, marketing outreach, and farmer education, we help build demand and encourage adoption across
Uganda’s livestock sector. This initiative reflects our commitment to circular economy solutions that convert
waste into wealth and create sustainable livelihoods.
Join Us in Expanding the Reach of Sustainable Innovations
Interworld invites businesses, farmers, institutions, and development partners to embrace and invest in these
transformative solutions. Whether it is Supertech, organic fertilizers, or Calcifeed, we create awareness,
market these innovations, and connect them to the users and institutions that stand to benefit. Our
commitment is to ensure that impactful technologies reach the right markets, improve community livelihoods,
and deliver measurable development outcomes.
Partnering with Interworld means contributing to a movement that reduces pollution while improving industrial
efficiency, strengthens food security and agricultural productivity, builds resilient communities supported by
sustainable technologies, and ensures groundbreaking innovations achieve widespread adoption. This is the
power of applied knowledge and strategic marketing. This is Interworld’s commitment to a sustainable and
prosperous future.
